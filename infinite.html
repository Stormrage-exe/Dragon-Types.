            <h2 class="lefttext">INFINITE DRAGONFLIGHT</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">Prophets warn that to know the moment of one's death is to invite madness and despair. Given the choice, few would willingly accept such a glimpse into their future, yet such is said to be the reality for every member of the bronze dragonflight. As keepers of time who navigate the pathways of the past, present, and future, such knowledge is both an unavoidable reality and an inevitable fate due to the sacred titan pledge that prohibits their interference.</p>
            <p class="lefttext">Yet what if the future held something truly catastrophic, a vision of death and carnage so
consuming that it threatened the entirety of existence? When weighed against preserving the sanctity of all life in the universe, of what possible value is a titan directive? Given the chance to alter such a grim future, who wouldn't be tempted to stray from the primary timeline? The correct decision seems to lie somewhere between the opposing directives of the bronze and infinite dragonflights.
With the powers of the Aspects lost and the Hour of Twilight averted, all we can do is hope that our defiance of the infinite dragonflight's vision proves to be the right choice.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/zHtzJs8y/05e394a5-86ec-4978-99ce-3c42f8691913-removebg-preview.png" class="b"></img>
            <h2 class="righttext">MUROZOND</h2>
            <h4 class="righttext">The Lord of the Infinite - Corrupted Aspect of Time - Leader of the Infinite Dragonflight</h4>
            <p class="righttext">No one knows whether Nozdormu's corruption is the result of upholding his oath to the one true timeline or of betraying it.
It is said that, from the moment of Nozdormu's ascension to Aspect, he already knew the way his life would end. If this is true, then it may also mean that the Timeless One has carried the burden of his inevitable corruption over the many long millennia of his existence.
Such intricacies of time are often difficult for mortals to grasp, for the infinite branching possibilities of the pathways are simply too vast to comprehend. In the simplest terms, for every change made, a ripple of consequence is created that often proves far worse than the original tragedy it sought to avert. It is for this reason that the bronze dragonflight's prime duty lies in safeguarding the sanctity of the one true timeline.</p>
            <p class="righttext">Despite the importance of his charge, it is known that the Aspect of Time will eventually turn away from the directive of Highkeeper Ra and seek to bring about the end of all life on Azeroth. For Nozdormu, his transformation into the corrupted Murozond has always been not a matter of if, but when. Yet with the Hour of Twilight averted, the question arises whether Nozdormu's grim future has been changed or whether the victory over Deathwing was merely an expected step along the path to the true End Time. That the infinite dragonflight continues to meddle with the flow of time and seek the Aspect's corruption seems to warn the latter.</p>

            <h2 class="lefttext">OCCULUS</h2>
            <h4 class="lefttext">The Pure - The Corrupted</h4>
            <p class="lefttext">Occulus was once a devoted member of the bronze dragonflight and a guardian of the Caverns of Time, so his sudden corruption was as chilling as it was mysterious. The young drake was soon discovered roaming the searing Tanaris desert while prophesying about the rise of the infinite and the end of the Keepers of Time.
Unsettling as his madness was, it was the drake's altered appearance that most disturbed the bronze dragons who dared to approach. In place of his brilliant, golden scales was a hide blackened to deepest night, interlaced with cracks of raw, colorless energy.
As Occulus foretold, he was not the last time- shattered dragon the bronzes would encounter.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">EPOCH HUNTER</h2>
            <h4 class="righttext">Agent of the Infinite Dragonflight</h4>
            <p class="righttext">Seeming to lie at the heart of the infinite dragonflight's early mission was the Legion's second invasion of Azeroth. For reasons that remain unknown, the infinites sought to change the history of the Legion's defeat by going back in time to remove any hero capable of preventing Azeroth's destruction.
To these ends, the infinite sent the drake Epoch Hunter to interfere with Thrall's historic escape from Durnholde Keep. Raised by the human Aedelas Blackmoore and trained as both a gladiator and a strategist, it was from this fated moment that the Horde gained its most essential
and respected Warchief and the Earthen Ring gained its most powerful shaman. Most historians believe that, without Thrall to lead the Horde and broker peace with the other factions of Kalimdor, the Legion would have claimed our world.
Thanks to the efforts of several mortals and the guidance of the bronze dragons Andormu and Erozion, Epoch Hunter was defeated, and the sanctity of the timeline was restored.
Remove the keystone, and even the mightiest
structure will come crashing down.</p>

            <h2 class="lefttext">AEONUS, DEJA & TEMPORUS</h2>
            <h4 class="lefttext">Chrono-Lords of the Infinite Dragonflight</h4>
            <p class="lefttext">Deep within the Black Morass, a group of mortal champions bore witness to the historic moment as the last guardian of Azeroth summoned a gateway between worlds. This figure was Medivh, the most powerful human mage to ever exist, and the moment was the opening of the Dark Portal that ushered in the orc invasion of Azeroth. Yet rather than alter such a tragic event to prevent the resultant war it created (as many might expect), the group was sent by Andormu to safeguard it from a concerted attack led by Temporus of the infinite dragonflight.</p>
            <p class="lefttext">After their earlier failure to kill Thrall, the infinite chose a moment further back in time in which they could prevent the arrival of the orc clans altogether. To overwhelm the mortal defenders protecting Medivh, several portals were opened to admit waves of corrupted dragonkin in advance of Temporus and Chrono-Lord Deja's arrival in the battle. Though the infinite forces threatened to overwhelm the fighters at many points, they ultimately triumphed over the time-stop spell work of Aeonus and ensured the completion of Medivh's crucial task.</p>
            <p class="lefttext">Though the defenders are largely seen as heroes for preserving the timeline, many wonder if it wouldn't have been better to allow the infinite dragonflight to stop Medivh. As witness to so many of the resulting tragedies of my former master's actions, I, too, am guilty of spending countless hours in such endless and tiring debate. Yet for all the horrific loss of life incurred during the First and Second wars, historians largely agree that, without the combined might of the Horde and the Alliance, the Legion's second (and, most likely, third) invasion of Azeroth would have succeeded.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/b59b1Bkm/ezgif-66b3578a8ebec8-removebg-preview.png" class="f"></img>
            <h2 class="righttext">ETERNUS</h2>
            <p class="righttext">Exhibiting a deadly combination of keen intelligence and ruthless determination, Eternus has emerged as one of the most concerning members of the infinite dragonflight. As with most of her brood, it is said that she sees their infinite condition not as corruption, but as the inevitable evolution of dragonkind. Likewise, she claims that the conversion of Nozdormu into
the infinite Aspect will herald the next major advancement for her dragonflight and their control of the time pathways.
Though she doesn't seem to share the same aggressive tendencies as others of the infinite brood, Eternus is said to view the bronze's titan directive as heavily flawed and a subversion of dragonkind's true destiny.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/NdVLYB7D/202307141658239120-removebg-preview.png" class="g"></img>
            <h2 class="lefttext">CHRONO-LORD DEIOS</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">As with most infinite plots, it is unknown whether Chrono-Lord Deios acted upon his own plans or served as part of a more concerted campaign. What seems certain, however, is that his primary goal was to prevent the Aspects from regaining their lost power.
After a group of champions was sent to explore the possible existence of an important
artifact in the keeper vault of Uldaman, Chrono- Lord Deios interfered with their attempt, to ensure none could challenge the infinite's control of the timeways. Chrono-Lord Deios's efforts to prevent our success in Uldaman gives some small hope that perhaps a path does exist to averting the Aspects' fall.</p>
