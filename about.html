       <h1>üêâ About This Site üêâ</h1>
       <p>Welcome, fellow dragon enthusiast!This site is a personal project born out of my deep love for dragons,especially the majestic and lore-rich dragons of the Warcraft universe. Most of the information you‚Äôll find here comes directly from the Dragonflight Codex, a fantastic source that dives into the history, behavior, and essence of each dragonflight.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve spent countless hours reading about the lore of nearly every known dragon type, and I can‚Äôt describe how happy it makes me to share all of it with the world. These dragons are more than just creatures in a game,they‚Äôre part of a rich, magical world that‚Äôs been a huge part of my life and imagination.</p>
<p>This site was handcrafted using mostly HTML and CSS, with a bit of JavaScript added in to spice things up,like the fun facts, which are randomly generated to surprise you with each visit! I‚Äôve put my heart into making this both informative and fun, just like the dragons themselves.
    Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring the world of Azeroth‚Äôs dragons as much as I do!</p>
    <p>If you'd like to support me to work on any future projects you can donate any amount on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/stormrage">Ko-Fi</a>. Much appreciated. :)</p>
