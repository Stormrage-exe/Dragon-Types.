            <h2 class="lefttext">DRAGONKIN</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">Dragonkin (or dragonkind) are all creatures descended from and including dragons,from drakes to drakonid. Nearly all dragonkin belong to one of the main or lesser dragonflights.</p>
            <h4 class="lefttext">LIFE CYCLE OF DRAGONS</h4>
            <p class="lefttext">As with most reptilian life on Azeroth, dragons are oviparous and thus produce their young by way of eggs that hatch after a set period of maturation. While the incubation time from egg to whelp remains a secret of the dragonflights, one can identify an egg nearing its prime by its rough, stony texture and the appearance of protective spikes.
              I'm told that the defense of such vulnerable young is the responsibility of the entire flight, who gather their eggs into large clutches where they are well guarded within their individual sanctums. It is also said that such close contact before hatching allows clutch-mates to form special bonds due to a keen awareness shared by all egg-bound dragons.
              Upon emerging from the egg, a typical whelp measures approximately half the size of an average human and is quickly capable of both flight and limited breath attacks. Though impressive, the whelp stage of development is often the most dangerous for a dragon because they have yet to develop the armored scales of its older brethren. After an egg hatches, it may take a decade or more for a whelp to reach maturity.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">HUMANOID</h2>
            <p class="righttext">All native life on Azeroth can trace its roots back to one of four ancient sources: the wild elementals, the seeping void of the Old Gods, the titan Eonar and the Emerald Dream, or the titan constructs who suffered the curse of flesh. In the beginning, only the elements of earth, fire, wind, and water held dominion over the land, with each waging an endless war upon the others. Though each was a strong and chaotic force of nature, the elemental lords' division made them weak and easily defeated upon the arrival of the Old Gods. Facing no further resistance after the subjugation of the elemental armies, the Black Empire rose to dominate Azeroth with its endless spread of insectoid aqir, faceless n'raqi, and C'Thraxxi Warbringers.
              It took the might of the Pantheon to break the Old Gods' malignant hold and to banish the elemental lieutenants to their alternate realms. Yet despite the keepers' best efforts, minions of both armies managed to escape complete containment. The aqir of the Black Empire burrowed deep underground to await the eventual return of their masters, and many
              Determining a species' core origin is not always so easy, especially if one relies on sight alone. While admittedly a logical notion, many erroneously believe (as I once did) that the many physical similarities shared by dragonspawn, drakonids, dracthyr, and ordered dragons mean that they hold a shared lineage. However, the warriors and servants who aid the dragonflights bear no direct descendance from dragons themselves. Instead, they are humanoids who were altered to serve the needs of their respective flights. So while the same type of Order magic may have been the catalysts for their startling transformations, abilities, and longevity, these devoted guardians of the dragonflights are still of mortal birth.
              Lastly, we come to the various dragonlike species drawn from the Emerald Dream and the vibrant titan enclaves that gave rise to the vast diversity of life on Azeroth. Though creatures such as faerie dragons and dragonhawks also bear many striking similarities to ordered dragons, neither is truly related to dragonkind. Still, it is not unusual to see these intelligent beings within the presence of dragons due to
              of the elementals evolved over time into the first overlapping habitats and a shared affinity for
              primal dragons.
              both the arcane and the Emerald Dream.</p>

            <h2 class="lefttext">DRACTHYR</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">While drakonid and dragonspawn are honored members of their various dragonflights, these indispensable warriors are not without their limitations. The powers they gain from their dragon allies tend to be in the form of increased strength, longevity, and immunity to their flight's particular elemental affinity. Those capable of wielding magic do so through a combination of mortal aptitude and rigorous training, yet they will never reach even a portion of their dragon masters' inherent potency.
              As the threat of war rose between the Incarnates and the dragonflights, Neltharion sought new methods of enhancing their dragonkin allies as an effective counter to the Primalists' tarasek fighters. Though the red Aspect Alexstrasza and Vyranoth the Frozenheart both believed war could be averted between their two sides.
              Fearing reprisal from the Dragon Queen, who did not believe that war was an inevitability for which to prepare, Neltharion continued his experiments in secret until he discovered a method to combine the powers of the five dragonflights with the cunning and ingenuity of the mortal races. These intelligent new dragonkin, which he called dracthyr, were capable of wielding elemental energies, tapping into the Emerald Dream, and even utilizing limited visages.
              While the dracthyr were ultimately left behind in the statis field created by Malygos following the attack by Raszageth the Storm-Eater, it is speculated that Neltharion's later efforts to create the chromatic dragonflight may have originated from the dracthyr.</p>

            <h2 class="lefttext">ASCENDANT</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">While the exact ritual used to create ascendants remains unknown, the process is believed to follow the arcane principle of transference, in which the essence of one unfortunate creature is siphoned and redirected into another. Since such dark magic exists primarily within the spell work of warlocks, it is likely that either Fel or Void energies are required in its casting.
              Due to the ethical considerations of sacrificing one life to enhance another, this practice is forbidden within the dragonflights and throughout most learned societies of Azeroth. Still, this does not mean that ascendants haven't been made in times of war or by forces with little concern for the sanctity of life. This was most recently seen when the Twilight's Hammer siphoned the energy of elementals into its most powerful cultists.
              Perhaps the most infamous ascendants ever created were those discovered in service to the Dragonmaw clan of Shadowmoon Valley.
              Produced by siphoning the essence of netherwing dragons into the bodies of fel-infused orcs, the resulting hulks served as the defenders and taskmasters of the clan's mining and dragon training operation near the Black Temple. Considering the Dragonmaw's long alliance with Sinestra and the inclusion of netherwing essence in her experiments, it is quite possible that the twilight dragonflight owes its existence to the dark ascendant rituals of the orcs.
              The only tome known to outline the process
              in full is Forbidden Rites and Other Rituals Necromantic. It was
              destroyed by a band of heroes who infiltrated Scholomance. What? You didn't think I'd actually reveal the technique, did you?</p>
            <img src="" class="f"></img>
            <h2 class="righttext">TARASEK</h2>
            <p class="righttext">Like many creatures of the Dragon Isles, the tarasek bear limited draconic traits yet are believed to have evolved independently of the primal dragons. Before their inclusion within both the dragonflight and Primalist forces, the tarasek lived a rustic and wild existence that lacked the defined social structures of their respective dragon allies.
              An important distinction I've come to learn is that not all tarasek who serve the draconic
              have been enhanced. To serve the dragonflights, tarasek must be altered by Order magic to accelerate their evolution into the various drakonid forces. Those pledged to the Primalists, however, were given the choice of whether to be infused with elemental power; this stemmed from the Incarnates' core belief that no one should be forced to change their physiology merely to serve their cause.</p>
            <img src="" class="g"></img>
            <h2 class="lefttext">WYRMKIN</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">Misconceptions abound regarding the nature, purpose, and origins of the dragonspawn species. With their draconic features and uniquely quadrupedal forms, it is easy to conclude that they must be aberrations of the dragons themselves. Yet if the enhancements of Wyrmkin share any commonalities with the more humanoid servants of the dragonflights, then perhaps they, too, can be traced to mortal origins.
              Tantalizing, however, are the many ancient tales told among the trolls, elves, tauren, and other cultures speaking of those who pledged themselves to the dragons and were rewarded with a draconic form. Still, stories are not fact,
              and since the dragons are not forthcoming on the topic, we must leave this as a theory, at best.
              Encompassing the vast majority of a flight's dragonspawn force, Wyrmkin serve a similar purpose as the mortal rank of foot soldier. Though known to be fierce fighters and defenders, they require firm leadership to be fully utilized. Those exhibiting an affinity for the arcane or a mind for battle tactics are typically elevated to command positions as either Flametongues or Scalebanes. Though largely content to wield their blades in service to their given flight, Wyrmkin have been known to take on missions of great importance.</p>
            <img src="" class="h"></img>
            <h2 class="righttext">FLAMETONGUES</h2>
            <p class="righttext">Highly honored and respected among the dragonspawn warrior class, I am told that the title of Flametongue is reserved for the few who show exceptional skill in combat, strategy, and battalion leadership. Their superior intellect often grants them the privilege of wielding unique and rare artifacts held by their particular dragonflight, along with the necessary tutelage to master techniques of spell casting, when applicable. Within the dragonspawn hierarchy, a Flametongue's main purpose is to act as the tacticians of a field command and to devise new solutions in the heat of combat. Typically seen with sword and shield in hand while on the battlefield, Flametongues can be difficult to distinguish from basic Wyrmkin, although the aftermath of their arcane mastery is quite unmistakable.</p>
            <img src="" class="i"></img>
            <h2 class="lefttext">SCALEBANES</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">Placed at the very apex of the Wyrmkin ranks are the heavily armored warriors and veteran commanders known as Scalebanes. Though little is known of their existence beyond the battlefield, these elite fighters are honored for their proven prowess in both physical combat and battlefield spell casting. Unlike Flametongues, who tend to have a slighter build due to their deeper focus on the intellectual pursuits of tactics and magic, Scalebanes are highly disciplined veterans who have mastered all levels of their offensive and defensive training. As the most devout followers of their dragonflight's purpose, Scalebanes are often recognized for their exceptional service with gifts of enchanted weaponry and the finest armor.</p>
