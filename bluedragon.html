                    <h2 class="lefttext">BLUE DRAGONFLIGHT</h2>
                    <p class="lefttext">The story of the blue dragonflight is one of great valor, bitter betrayal, and grief. Though each flight suffered grave losses during the War of the Ancients, none had paid such a staggering price, nor harbored such an enduring hatred for those seen as responsible. With one blast of the Dragon Soul, nearly all of Malygos's flight was wiped out, including his prime consort, Sindragosa. The pain of those losses drove the Aspect of Magic deep into the Nexus.
                      Following Queen Azshara's actions at the Well of Eternity, the blue dragonflight had largely
                      come to view all mortals as reckless creatures unworthy of wielding magic, including the nearby Shandaral Highborne of Northrend. Stranded after the Sundering from the kaldorei empire and the World Tree Nordrassil, these elven survivors coveted the blue dragons' ability to crystalize living matter into coalesced energy as a replacement for the Well of Eternity that provided their immortality and arcane power.
                      Rather than offer aid, the blue dragonflight met the elves' entreaties with open hostility for fear that the Highborne would repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
                      <p class="lefttext">Anger and desperation then drove the elves to breach the Nexus and steal the dragonflight's arcane techniques and artifacts; a brazen act that led to the blues' counteroffensive to eradicate the Highborne outpost of Moonsong. In facing certain destruction, the elven mages unleashed the power they had stolen against the wrathful blues, which set off an explosion that crystallized the forest. Twisted by the wild arcane energies, the spirits of the doomed Shandaral wander the shattered boughs of Crystalsong Forest to this very day.
                        In time, the flight's ancient biases were tempered by the influence of the other dragonflights who had stepped in to care for Malygos's clutch in his absence. Unlike the elder blues, this new generation of dragons accepted both the titan mantle of arcane guardianship and the dragonflights' sacred duty to protect Azeroth. Though they initially hid their true identities behind mortal visages, younger blues sought membership within the Kirin Tor to offer their support, and to ensure that the elite of mages Azeroth did not misuse magic again.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/prBbr5qH/MALYGOS.png" class="b"></img>
                    <h2 class="righttext">MALYGOS</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">The Spell-Weaver - Aspect of the Blue Dragonflight Guardian of Magic</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">As one of the five primal dragons to face the might of Galakrond, Malygos was entrusted by Keeper Loken with command over the arcane and celestial powers of the titan Norgannon. Remembered by his fellow Aspects as a stalwart defender until the near destruction of his flight at the Well of Eternity, Malygos retreated to the Nexus, where he became utterly lost to his grief. Though the sparse remnants of his flight continued their titan charge in his absence, the Aspect of Magic was not seen again until the aftermath of the Second War.
                      Stirred by the discovery of Deathwing's return and a chance to free Alexstrasza from the Dragonmaw clan, Malygos answered the call to join his fellow Aspects in the Battle of Grim Batol. Though unsuccessful in sating his ancient rage against Neltharion, the destruction of the Dragon Soul and the release of the Aspect's trapped power restored a sliver of Malygos's sanity, allowing him to roam the Nexus with his flight once more. It was in this state that he encountered the attacking nether dragons brought from Outland by Tyrygosa. For reasons I have yet to discern, the consumption of their energy led to the Aspect's full awakening and the recollection of his sacred duties. Yet upon assessing the state of magic on Azeroth, Malygos immediately turned his fury against the mortals, whom he believed posed a grave threat of drawing the Legion's attention.</p>
                      <p class="rightttext">To prevent that outcome, the Aspect of Magic ordered his dragonflight to divert Azeroth's leylines to the Nexus so that their energy could be harmlessly channeled out into the Twisting Nether. In seeking the cause of the failing arcane pathways, the Kirin Tor sent an envoy to the
                        blue dragonflight's home in Coldarra; and the dragonflight was ultimately given an impossible choice: join Malygos's mad plans and become mage hunters, or perish in the frozen north. With the mad Aspect's intentions now clear, the decision was made to teleport Dalaran to Northrend, to then wage a united offensive against the Nexus.</p>
                        <p class="righttext">With the signing of the Wyrmrest Accord, the remaining dragonflights joined the champions of the Kirin Tor, Horde, and Alliance to storm Malygos's celestial domain, known as the Eye of Eternity. Though supported by the oldest and most loyal of his flight, the Aspect of Magic fell
                          before the brave heroes of the Accord, and his efforts to drain Azeroth of arcane power were subverted. At the time, we could not know that the quakes caused by Malygos's meddling would be but a shadow of what was to come during the Cataclysm.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/xp114sr/Kalecgos1.webp" class="c"></img>
                    <h2 class="lefttext">KALECGOS</h2>
                    <h4 class="lefttext">Aspect of the Blue Dragonflight - Kalec - Archmage of the Kirin Tor - Member of the Tirisgarde - Member of the Council of Six</h4>
                    <p class="lefttext">Known among scholars and mortals alike as one of the most kind and brilliant mages of the present era, Kalecgos contributed more to the defense of Azeroth than any other dragon. Though he no longer considers himself an Aspect, due to the loss of his titan-gifted powers following the fall of Deathwing, Kalecgos remains the leader of the blue dragonflight.
                      Encountered most often in a half-human, half- elven visage by the name of Kalec, the gifted blue was instrumental in restoring the Sunwell through his protection of the human avatar Anveena
                      Teague. Together with the Dragon Queen's consort, Korialstrasz, the two dragons battled the sin'dorei traitor Dar'Khan Drathir, who sought to siphon the power of the Sunwell for himself. After their enemy's defeat, Kalec steadfastly remained in Quel'Thalas to protect Anveena until her heroic sacrifice to weaken the Eredar lord Kil'jaeden and close the demonic gateway he had opened between Argus and Azeroth.
                      Fate would see Kalecgos and Korialstrasz cross paths again within the cursed halls of Grim Batol as they uncovered a plot by Sinestra of the black dragonflight to extract the essence of the escaped nether dragon Zzeraku and use it to create the twilight dragon Dargonax. Though Kalecgos and Korialstrasz were successful in defeating the black consort's creation, the destruction of Dargonax came at the grave cost of their draenei ally, the priestess Iridi, and Zzeraku himself.</p>
                      <p class="lefttext">Though largely absent from the events of the Nexus War, Kalecgos later played a pivotal role in altering the properties of the recovered Dragon Soul so that it could harm Deathwing, by use of Thrall's shamanistic powers. After helping to avert the Hour of Twilight by giving his power to destroy the Earth-Warder, Kalecgos turned his attention to pressing matters within Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. From his position as a member of the Council of Six, Kalec lent his aid to the red dragonflight during the attack by the twilight dragonflight led by Vexiona. Most recently, Kalecgos joined with the other leaders of the dragonflights to empower the Heart of Azeroth, an artifact used to draw upon the titan- created Forge of Origination in Uldum to defeat the Old God N'Zoth.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TBNCSY4c/sindragosa-custom.png" class="d"></img>
                    <h2 class="righttext">SINDRAGOSA</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">Prime Consort of Malygos - Veteran of the War of the Ancients</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">I have seen promises of power and vengeance lead many great leaders down the path of corruption, yet no story offers so stark a warning as that of the kaldorei queen, Azshara. Swayed by the promises of Sargeras after the arcane experiments of her Highborne drew the Dark Titan's notice, Azshara sought to create a portal that would allow the Burning Legion to descend upon Azeroth and purify the world of all she deemed as unworthy. To those wicked ends, the queen urged the Legion's demonic soldiers to flood the cities of Suramar and Zin-Azshari and slaughter any who dared to challenge her command.
                      In knowing that Sargaras's true intent was to destroy Azeroth, the dragonflights joined ranks with the elven resistance led by Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage to stand against the Legion. Yet powerful as the Aspects and druids were, they knew they could not defeat a Dark Titan alone. It was then that the black Aspect, Neltharion, offered a solution in the form of an unassuming golden disk: the Dragon Soul.</p>
                    <p class="righttext">With the defenders standing united against the Legion's onslaught, the Earth-Warder fired the weapon upon their enemies before
                      inexplicably turning it against his own allies in a stunning betrayal. As prime consort of Malygos, Sindragosa fought at the very core of the blue dragonflight in a position that placed her along the direct path of the energy torrent. Those not killed instantly were instead hurled into the farthest reaches of Northrend.
                      Legend says that Sindragosa, blinded and near death on a jagged mountainside in Icecrown, struggled desperately to reach the Dragonblight, the final resting place of all dragons. Though claw marks show her desperate descent down the icy slope, it soon became clear that the journey was beyond her failing ability. With the last of her energy, Sindragosa cried out to Malygos for help, only to hear the bitter winds of Northrend in response. Delirious and with a heart full of hatred, the blue consort is said to have cursed all who had led to her death: Neltharion for his betrayal, the Legion for its senseless crusade, and even her once beloved consort, Malygos, who had ignored her desperate pleas.
                      Yet Sindragosa's rage is said to burn hottest for the mortals whose reckless hubris brought the doom of the Legion upon Azeroth, an undying venom that later turned her into one of the Lich King's most destructive weapons in undeath.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/m1H9N5q/Kirygosa-dragon-form-removebg-preview.png" class="e"></img>
                    <h2 class="lefttext">BALACGOS</h2>
                    <h4 class="lefttext">Caretaker of Magic</h4>
                    <p class="lefttext">As an elder offspring of the blue Aspect Malygos, Balacgos was said to be especially gifted even among dragons who wielded the powers of the arcane with natural ease. Yet as any wise archmage will tell you, rarely does such raw skill and pride make space for sufficient caution.
                      In an eerie echo of his father's mad plan that led to the Nexus War, Balacgos sought to create an artifact that could harness the latent magic energies of Azeroth and lock them away from the recklessness of mortal practitioners. For this purpose, he designed a cube capable of absorbing and reserving energy that could be used later by the blue dragonflight. Though reviews of his
                      theory proved it was sound, the blue must have made a regrettably fatal calculation.
                      Upon activation of his flawed device, Balacgos's entire essence was drawn into the artifact, leaving behind only a lifeless husk. For this reason, the cube came to be known as Balacgos's Bane.
                      Lost for millennia after Malygos gave the device to Neltharion for safekeeping, the cube reappeared in the claws of Deathwing's prime consort, Sinestra, as she sought to produce her flight of twilight dragons. According to Kalecgos, this device allowed her to draw the energy of the nether dragon Zzeraku and redirect it into her new creation, the twilight behemoth Dargonax.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/5xYrkbnD/azuregos.png" class="f"></img>
                    <h2 class="righttext">AZUREGOS</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">Safekeeper of the Nexus - Spirit of Azurego - Mate of Anara</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">While dragons are often depicted as stoic and austere beings, it has been my experience that they tend to exhibit of the same emotions many as mortals. Traits such as humor, sarcasm, and passion not only offer them the ability to blend into other cultures while in their visages, but they also serve as a bridge to better understand the mortals they've sworn to protect. Yet of all the dragon emissaries I've encountered, none seems to have such a complete command of satire and subtlety as the blue dragon Azuregos.
                      Entrusted by Malygos to find and safeguard the flight's most powerful arcane artifacts, Azuregos frequented the elven ruins of Eldarath in southeastern Azshara. Curiosity over the blue dragon's repeated and prolonged visits led many mages to speculate about what treasures may lay hidden among the ancient Highborne temples; some even brazenly suggest that the missing Vials of Eternity were located there. The truth of what the blue dragon safeguarded turned out to be of equally grave importance.</p>
                    <p class="righttext">For more than five hundred Fandral Staghelm shattered the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, Azuregos acted as one of the three guardians of the scepter shards. Though he carried out his sacred duty without fail, the blue believed that, as long as rumors of a powerful relic existed, it could one day become a beacon to would-be heroes seeking glory and treasure. In the end, his prediction proved correct.
                      After guiding a group of worthy champions to the shard so they could battle the Old God C'Thun, Azuregos was attacked by a roving band of miscreant fighters. Unwilling to return to the physical world, Azuregos instead hid away in the spirit realm, where he formed a relationship with the spirit healer Anara. Though the demands of his flight eventually required his return to the Nexus, it was with a heavy heart that the dragon departed her realm to serve as the Safekeeper of the Nexus.</p>
                      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/W44FcCc5/Arygos-removebg-preview.png" class="g"></img>
                    <h2 class="lefttext">ARYGOS</h2>
                    <h4 class="lefttext">Son of Malygos - Veteran of the War of the Shifting Sands - Ally of the Twilight and the Infinite</h4>
                    <p class="lefttext">The legacy of Arygos is one of selfless valor, pure arrogance, and an inability to abandon old hatreds. As one of the dragons to heed the bronze call for aid against the aqir of Ahn'Qiraj, Arygos sacrificed himself during the final battle of the War of the Shifting Sands to ensure victory. Fighting alongside the green dragon Merithra and the red dragon Caelestrasz, Arygos and his allies managed to force the enemy swarms back into the city long enough for the Scarab Wall to be raised. Believed dead by all who fought that day, the unimaginable truth was that all three dragons had survived only to be subjected to the inhumane horror of captivity by the Old God C'Thun.
                      Though the trio never spoke willingly of that dark time, it is known that they fought the madness of the Void for a thousand years until the Scarab Gong was rung and the wall was brought down. Freed from their torment at last, the three dragon heroes refused to abandon the assault. Instead, they rallied alongside the champions who had amassed, hoping to end the Old God's growing influence for good.
                      Ignoring the fact that his rescue from the accursed city was made possible only by the presence of mortals, Arygos resurfaced many years after the end of the Ahn'Qiraj War as a staunch supporter of Malygos's mad plan to cut off all sources of magic from the younger races of Azeroth. Even in the wake of the Nexus War,
                      Arygos was unable to see the error of his father's actions and the necessity of the Aspect's death at the hands of the Wyrmrest Accord.</p>
                    <p class="lefttext">Seeking to continue his father's work, Arygos asserted his claim as heir and demanded the position and powers of the blue Aspect. Despite the damage Malygos had wrought, the flight remained divided between Arygos's old hatreds and Kalecgos's desire to work alongside the mortal races. In the end, Thrall's impassioned speech convinced the blue dragonflight to choose with their hearts and move beyond the intolerance fostered by Malygos and his son Arygos, leading to Kalecgos' ascension during a sacred celestial event known as the Embrace.
                      Embittered by his flight's rejection and Thrall's meddling, Arygos called upon the Twilight Father to help enact his revenge. Seeing instead an opportunity to aid the infinite dragonflight, the Twilight Father enacted a bold plan to bring an alternate version of Aedelas Blackmoore, the master of Durnholde Keep who had raised Thrall, into their timeline to carry out the shaman's death. Just as he believed his vengeance was nearly at hand, Arygos was instead betrayed by Aedelas, who plunged his sword into the blue's skull. Using the dragon's blood to activate a powerful artifact known as the Focusing Iris, the enemy forces managed to animate the only true chromatic dragon in existence: Chromatus.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/fd0gW4qM/600060-nightbane-removebg-preview.png" class="h"></img>
                    <h2 class="righttext">ARCANAGOS / NIGHTBANE</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">Ally to the Guardian of Tirisfal</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">While the corrupted Guardian Medivh managed to conceal most of his meetings with Gul'dan, their opening of the Dark Portal linking Draenor and Azeroth was a far less subtle affair. Though most with an affinity for magic felt the shockwave of energy, none could pinpoint the exact source of the disturbance except for the former Guardian of Tirisfal. After enlisting the aid of her dragon ally Arcanagos, Aegwynn set off to investigate the area of swampland south of Stormwind City known as the Black Morass. There, she was stunned
                      to behold the madness her son had created: a magical doorway connecting Azeroth to a world controlled by the Burning Legion.Flying immediately to the nearby tower of Karazhan, Aegwynn sought to confront Medivh, who was busy entertaining many Stormwind's nobles. After a heated argument, she came to the startling realization that her son was possessed by the Dark Titan, Sargeras, who sought to use Medivh's immense power to open a gateway for a new invasion of Azeroth.</p>
                    <p class="righttext">The ensuing battle between mother and son shook the mighty towers to their foundations until Aegwynn was struck down, leading to Arcanagos's swift intervention. In response to the loyal blue's interference, the Dark Titan forced Medivh to burn Arcanagos from the inside out, cursing the dragon's skeletal remains with a fiery form of undeath. Fearing that Aegwynn could gain the upper hand, Sargeras drew upon the life energies of the fleeing guests in a desperate bid to end the former Guardian of Tirisfal. Yet in that most dire moment, Medivh
                      managed to claw back control from Sargeras in order to teleport Aegwynn away to safety.
                      Though few have seen the dreadful skeletal dragon known as Nightbane in recent years, I can assure you that reports still surface on occasion from both travelers and members of the Violet Eye who are tasked with keeping watch over the grounds on behalf of the Kirin Tor. For this reason, it would be quite unwise for anyone to trespass on the terrace of Karazhan, which long served as the fallen blue's primary domain.</p>
                      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/C5Q8CNCp/Tyrygosa-removebg-preview.png" class="i"></img>
                    <h2 class="lefttext">TYRYGOSA</h2>
                    <h4 class="lefttext">Tyri - Member of the Wyrmrest Accord</h4>
                    <p class="lefttext">While accompanying Kalecgos during his investigation of the Scourge in Lordaeron,Tyrygosa became part of the group that found and protected the mysterious Anveena Teague. Together with the red dragon Korialstrasz, the three defeated the elven traitor Dar'Khan, who sought to claim the energy of the Sunwell contained within Anveena for himself. Though betrothed to Kalecgos at the time of their mission, the two parted ways soon afterward due to Kalec's professed love for Anveena, whom he had sworn to protect. Instead, Tyrygosa soon found herself in Outland, where she become involved with the plight of the nether dragons.
                      Upon realizing that Zzeraku and his nether brood were the twisted remnants of Deathwing's lost clutch, Tyrygosa worked to free them from the renegade death knight Ragnok Bloodreaver, who wished to use the childlike creatures in his efforts to conquer Outland. Seeking to heal the dragons who had experienced such cruelty during their captivity, Tyrygosa brought the
                      nether dragons to the Nexus so that they could be rejuvenated by the structure's arcane energies. Though Zzeraku and his brood quickly regained their strength after feasting on the abundant power, they feared the true motives behind Tyrygosa's kindness. Believing that their only chance to avoid subjugation again was to claim the Nexus's unlimited power for themselves, Zzeraku led his brood in an assault against the blue dragonflight that ultimately led to the awakening of Malygos and the Nexus War.
                      Tyrygosa returned to Northrend briefly to fight alongside the dragonflights during the siege of Wyrmrest Temple and the Hour of Twilight, but she has sworn herself to the noble task of safeguarding what remains of the nether brood after the tragic events at the Nexus. While she has answered the call for the blue dragonflight to reunite, at the time of this telling, Tyragosa's efforts appear focused on a thriving brood located in an energy-rich area of Outland known as Netherstorm.</p>
