            <h2 class="lefttext">FROSTBROOD</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">And the bells rang for his return...
Those present on that fateful day speak of its festival atmosphere, a celebration that drew hopeful citizens to the capital of Lordaeron from the farthest reaches of the kingdom. So many desperate months had passed since their beloved prince had set off for Northrend in search of the plague's cause, leading many to believe that his return heralded an end to their suffering. Little could they know that an even worse fate awaited them.
With rose petals raining down upon Arthas Menethil's every step, none seemed to notice the prince's many changes. In place of his golden paladin's armor, he now wore a vicious set of spiked saronite. Missing, too, was his hammer, replaced with a sword seemingly formed from the
very hoarfrost of Northrend itself. Those most astute later recalled a strange glow to the prince's eyes, an effect most had only ever seen among the neighboring high elves of Quel'Thalas. Yet before such details had a
chance to illicit concern, the prince moved along to be welcomed home by his father.
Though it seems unlikely after so many years, the stain of King Terenas's bloody crown remains visible upon the majestic inlays of Lordaeron's throne room. Whether as a display of loyalty to the Lich King or merely a depraved desire to cut all ties to his mortal life, Arthas Menethil killed his father moments before unleashing an army of unthinking, unliving creatures upon his own people.</p>
            <p class="lefttext">Among the most deadly and destructive of his vast undead forces were the Frostbrood, a flight of terrifying skeletal dragons raised from the remains found beyond the sacred boundaries of the Dragonblight.
Even all these many years later, the scars of Arthas's march from Lordaeron to the Isle of Quel'Danas can still be seen. Though much of the dead and blackened earth has been scattered by the winds, the deep strafing lines of the Frostbrood's icy breath will remain forever etched upon the land.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">SAPPHIRON</h2>
            <h4 class="righttext">Key Guardian to the Focusing Iris - Guardian of Naxxramas</h4>
            <p class="righttext">As is the common charge of many blue dragons, Sapphiron was a devoted caretaker of arcane artifacts and a trusted guardian of his flight's most powerful device: the Focusing Iris. For reasons unknown, Sapphiron chose to carry out his sacred duty outside the Nexus in a lair located near the entrance to the nerubian city of Azjol Nerub. It was this decision that led to his unfortunate fate as an undead guardian for the necromancer Kel'Thuzad.
As Arthas Menethil's ship landed on the coast of Northrend to defend the Frozen Throne from Illidan, he came under fierce attack by a contingent of blood elves led by Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider, seeking vengeance for the fall of Quel Thalas. Most historians agree that Arthas would likely have met his end upon that craggy shore had it not been for the intervention of Anub'arak, a cryptlord originally of an aqir race known as the nerubians who had been raised into undeath to serve the Lich King. </p>
            <p class="righttext">While Arthas was successful in driving the elves into retreat, he feared that the battle had cost him precious time
and that he would not be able to reach Icecrown
before Illidan, who sought to destroy the Lich King. Not only did Anub'arak offer to guide Arthas through the underground city of Azjol- Nerub, but he also gave him the chance to acquire powerful artifacts by raiding Sapphiron's lair.
Though the blue dragon was initially amused by Arthas's stated intent to kill him, Sapphiron realized the error of his arrogance when he was quickly overwhelmed by the Scourge forces under the death knight's command. Not only did Arthas succeed in stealing the blue dragon's artifacts, but he also raised Sapphiron into a powerful frost wyrm with the last of his waning necromantic power.
After being forced to help Arthas in his quest to defend the Frozen Throne, Sapphiron was stationed in Naxxramas. It was from here that Kel'Thuzad carried out the work of the Lich King, with Sapphiron serving as guardian to the necromancer's inner sanctum.
As with all other souls taken by the
mourneblade Frostmourne, Sapphiron's essence was released into the Shadowlands after the defeat
of Arthas and the shattering of his accursed sword.</p>

            <h2 class="lefttext">SINDRAGOSA</h2>
            <h4 class="lefttext">The Frost Queen - Queen of the Frostbrood</h4>
            <p class="lefttext">The rise of the Frost Queen began with her initial proud blue would have bristled to be brought downfall at the claws of Deathwing. Caught in the catastrophic blast of the Dragon Soul that similarly doomed much of her flight, Sindragosa was flung into the far reaches of Northrend by the enormous blast. Sensing that she was near to death, the blue consort attempted to fly to the Dragonblight; however, she proved too weak to make such a distance and crashed into a mountainside within Icecrown. With the last of her energy, she cried out to her beloved mate, Malygos, but heard only the uncaring winds in response. And so, for more than ten thousand years, Sindragosa's broken body lay forgotten in the ancient glacier of the frozen north.
under another's control in life, within the Lich King's unyielding command lay the fulfillment of her dying wish for vengeance. </p>
            <p class="lefttext">With a resounding crack of ice that resonated throughout the snow- bound wastes of Icecrown, the skeletal form of Sindragosa rose from her icy tomb to deliver death upon the living.
But then she felt something, a pull of dark energy that called to her and commanded her to rise in undeath and serve the will of another. Fury tore through her mind, for the mate who had ignored her call and the asinine mortals who had brought the Legion down upon Azeroth in their folly to wield the arcane. Though the once
Years after her defeat at Icecrown, Sindragosa's spirit was finally set to rest alongside Malygos's by Kalecgos on the Dragon Isles.
Sindragosa uas not the only dragon found in Icecrown Citadel. While theories abound, the Lich King's plan for Valithria of the green dragonflight remains unknown.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">SARATHSTRA</h2>
            <h4 class="righttext">Scourge of the North</h4>
            <p class="righttext">Seeking to disrupt the Alliance and Horde forces amassing to breech Angrathar the Wrath Gate, the Lich King ordered several of his Frostbrood to claim the skies above the Dragonblight and terrorize his enemies. Rokhan of the Darkspears and his shadowhunters managed to bring down most of the skeletal dragons with relative ease, but one proved far more cunning than the rest: Sarathstra.
After recruiting several skilled veterans of the Horde to retrieve the dragon's frozen heart, Rokhan lured the frost wyrm into a clever trap
and then led the attack against the monstrous dragon. Over the course of the battle, Sarathstra unleashed an unusual mix of frost and shadow attacks but was ultimately slain through the combined might of the assembled fighters. Though the heart was given over to Captain Gort at the Horde outpost of Agmar's Hammer, there is no official record of what became of it.
Field records state that Rokhan lost a number
of his dragon hunters to extreme fall damage.</p>
