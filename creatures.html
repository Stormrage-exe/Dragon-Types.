            <h2 class="lefttext">CLOUD SERPENTS</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">The origin of Pandaria's cloud serpents remains as mysterious as the mist-shrouded continent they inhabit. While many scholars speculate that the creatures' command of elemental powers points to a similar evolutionary path as that of primal dragons, the ancient legend of Alani the Stormborn offers a tantalizing alternative.
              First recounted by Loh-Ki the Storm Watcher, the story begins with a differing account of the emperor Lei Shen's final moments. An incredible storm of wild energy was being unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</p>
              <p class="lefttext"> At the apex of the tempest's fury, a bolt of lightning struck the center of Whitepetal Lake, setting its crystalline waters ablaze. The mystical fire burned unabated for many days before revealing the creation of a cloud serpent hatchling. Witnesses to this miraculous event claimed that the serpent's scales flashed with the ferocity of the storm that created her and thus named her Alani the Stormborn.
                For many generations afterward, the inhabitants of Pandaria reportedly admired the cloud serpents from afar, never daring to approach the majestic and cunning beasts.
                Then came another terrible storm that roared through the Jade Forest. Upon surveying the damage the following day, a pandaren named Jiang discovered an injured hatchling who had been thrown from his nest. Jiang decided to nurse him back to health. A lasting bond formed between the pair as a result of the pandaren's kindness. One day, when Lo was but half grown, he saved Jiang from the grips of the encroaching Zandalari, spiriting her to safety on his back. This gave Jiang an idea. Though the pandaren were skilled fighters, they had little defense against the trolls' deadly bat riders. On the backs of cloud serpents, however, they could take the fight to the air. Together, Lo and Jiang managed to break the troll ranks, proving the immense value of dragon riding and leading to the formation of the Order of the Cloud Serpents.
                The bonds of loyalty between cloud serpent and rider are said to be so strong that, for decades after Jiang sacrificed her life to kill the troll leader Mengazi and stop the revival of Lei Shen, Lo continued to fly above the village searching for
                the beloved friend he'd lost.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">ELEMENTAL DRAGONS</h2>
            <p class="righttext">Scholars agree that most dragons evolved from wild elementals that existed in the physical realm of Azeroth. However, growing evidence indicates that a reverse progression may have occurred, in which several primal dragons found their way into the various Elemental Planes. Though they retained much in the way of their original draconic form, it appears that the volatile forces of each environment altered their physiology, creating a new species known as elemental dragons. Whether this theory of their origins will hold true, only time will tell.
              Although it's possible mortals may have encountered such dragons before, the discovery of elemental dragons was only formally acknowledged after the Cataclysm opened a pathway into the Elemental Plane of Deepholm,
              thus exposing the existence of its Stone dragons. Much remains unknown about this brood and its habits, due to the dragons' inability to use speech. However, they seem much like early primal dragons, in that they value raw strength and aggression over cunning or intelligence. As a result, their leader and broodmother, Aeosera, was known to show deference to Deathwing while he inhabited Deepholm.
              Of a similar temperament are the Storm dragons of Skywall, who command the powers of wind and lightning in defense of the Elemental Plane of Air. Though many scholars seek to link the phoenixes of the Firelands to a similar path of development, an in-depth study of the fiery creatures has proven both highly dangerous and quite flammable.</p>

            <h2 class="lefttext">THORIGNIR</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">No one knows the true age of the Storm drakes of Stormheim, including the Thorignir themselves. However, a lack of inclusion within titan records leads most to believe that their brood evolved in isolation on the Broken Isles in the years following the Sundering. Led by Thrymjaris, who has chosen to ally her brood with Keeper Odyn and his Valajar army, the Thorignir are often called upon to aid in the infamous Trials
              of Valor, designed to test the might and worth of champions seeking glorious battle in Helheim.
              As with other intelligent broods, allegiance to the titans is not universally accepted by all Thorignir; this has resulted in a splinter faction currently led by Nithogg. Those who have been honored in the Halls of Valor would do well
              to avoid the area surrounding the mountain of Nastrondir.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">VEILWINGS</h2>
            <p class="righttext">Believed to be the only dragon species native to the Shadowlands, the Veilwings of Ardenweald are considered some of the fiercest defenders of the Winter Queen's realm. As such, they are held in the highest esteem by the Night Fae. While it is unknown whether Veilwings are creations of the First Ones or evolved from spirits sent through the Arbiter's will, they stand unique among the draconic for their gradient transition of scales
              into a glorious mane of feathers. Veilwings wield a variety of breath attacks similar to dragons on Azeroth, although they have adapted to use a native source of energy known as anima rather than the elements.
              The strength and beauty of the Veilwing is said to be so celebrated in Ardenweald that those who master the ability of soul shaping commonly choose to emulate their majestic forms.</p>

            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/1ttsZTz8/Faerie-Dragon-removebg-preview.png" class="e"></img>
            <h2 class="lefttext">FAERIE DRAGONS</h2>
            <p class="lefttext">Often described as diminutive, intelligent, and mischievous, faerie dragons have a history that is nearly as intertwined into the story of Azeroth as that of the dragonflights. Though not true dragons, these winged creatures commonly inhabit the same realms due to their intrinsic connection to the Emerald Dream and their natural affinity for finding fonts of power. In fact, legend states that it was by following faerie dragons to the Well of Eternity that a band of curious dark trolls eventually became the first elves.
              Known also by the name of sprite darter, blink dragon, and fey dragon, faerie dragons are largely capable of limited speech in a variety of local languages. Also unique is their elaborate command of the arcane for both offensive and defensive purposes. Such skills include the ability to disappear, blink from one location to another, and manipulate the magic of other casters by way of dampening, nullifying, or even causing a feedback effect of one's spell. For this reason, the priestesses of Elune have often called upon the faerie dragons to aid in the defense of Azeroth.
              While there are many places in which to view these playful tricksters in the wild, the forests of Feralas and Ashenvale offer the best chance, due to their abundance of elven ruins and many abandoned moonwells. Though it is a rather rare occurrence, it is said that faerie dragons occasionally converge upon a mysterious mushroom ring in an area of Tirisfal Glade known as the Whispering Forest. Those fortunate to have witnessed such a gathering speak of an elaborate display of singing, illumination, and dancing that often ends as suddenly as it begins.</p>

            <h2 class="righttext">DRAGONHAWKS</h2>
            <p class="righttext">So named for their blended appearance, dragonhawks are commonly confused for dragonkin due to their many physical similarities and unique ability to breathe fire. While their riders and handlers report them to be highly intelligent creatures who exhibit an affinity for the arcane, they lack a faerie dragon's ability to effectively wield it. Native mainly to the forests of Quel'Thalas and Zul'Aman, dragonhawks have been known to accompany their blood elf allies into a variety of historic battles, including the assault on Icecrown Citadel.
              As deft and adaptable predators, dragonhawks have been found thriving in various areas of Outland after the defeat of Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider's forces. Interestingly, while most reports claim that the eyes of dragonhawks in Quel'Thalas tend to have a blue glow, some have observed that those living in Outland often exhibit a green hue that seems a direct result of their intake of Fel energy.
              Now that I think of it, perhaps I'll assign this as field research to the next mage who thinks it's funny to leave a portal to Stonard open in the Dalaran library.</p>
