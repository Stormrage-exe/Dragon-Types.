                    <h2 class="lefttext">BRONZE DRAGONFLIGHT</h2>
                    <p class="lefttext">Hidden among the shifting sands of the great Tanaris desert lies an unassuming outcrop of basalt, its craggy features nearly as old as time itself. No grand gates speak to its importance; no carved monuments speak to its purpose beyond a haphazard collection of towers and hovels seemingly plucked from the farthest reaches of Azeroth. Yet wander too close, and you will be met by Chronalis and Tick, the site's timeless draconic guardians. Whether you are granted entrance to the Caverns of Time or sent to a windswept grave is not their decision, but rather, a consequence of fate.
                        If this seems cruel, it is because few mortals can truly grasp the bronze dragonflight's ability to exist outside of time itself. For us, the path is linear and predictable, with the present offering our only opportunity for change. For the bronze, however, the past, present, and future are infinitely accessible and infinitely corruptible. For this reason, Keeper Ra charged the flight with protecting the pathways from any who would seek to meddle with the keystone moments of Azeroth's history.
                        Given the enormity of their charge, the bronze spend most of their lives navigating time itself rather than meddling in our present mortal
                        affairs. This makes them the most elusive flight to encounter, but their fascination with Azeroth's history makes them staunch defenders of her ongoing future.
                        The dragonflights' efforts to defeat the Legion during the War of the Ancients is well documented, but the record of the bronze contribution is often incomplete. It is known that Nozdormu channeled his power into the Dragon Soul, but mortal accounts fail to capture, or perhaps make sense of, the many strange
                        temporal anomalies that later occurred. What these ancient historians could not know was that the bronze Aspect would send champions back in time to preserve Azeroth's future from the tampering of both the Old Gods and the infinite dragonflight.
                        Despite the dire prophetic knowledge that points to their seemingly inevitable corruption, Nozdormu and his bronze dragonflight continue to uphold their temporal duty to Azeroth while fighting the infinite dragonflight's efforts to bend the past, present, and future to its will.</p>

                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TML55g4L/1135767-nozdormu-removebg-preview.png" class="b"></img>
                    <h2 class="righttext">NOZDORMU</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">The Timeless One - Aspect of the Bronze Dragonflight - Murozond of the Infinite Dragonflight</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">Chosen by Highkeeper Ra to wield the power of the titan Aman'Thul, Nozdormu was one of the five dragons empowered after the defeat of Galakrond. Granted dominion over time itself, the bronze Aspect is said to spend much of his existence navigating the intricacies of the one true timeline and all its branching possibilities. Though I am told that his flight prefers to experience the heroics of old over meddling with mortal politics, Nozdormu and his brood have never failed to answer the call to aid in Azeroth's defense.
                        The first such crisis occurred in Northrend after the weakening of Yogg-Saron's prison led to the corruption of Keeper Loken and his accidental killing of Sif. Though none know for sure, it is believed that the mad whispers of the Old God eventually convinced him to betray
                        his fellow keepers and claim control over the titan facility of Ulduar. With unfettered access to the Forge of Wills, Loken created an army of titan-forged, who had been afflicted with the curse of flesh without his knowledge. These titan-forged would eventually become the giants, earthen, and vrykul with whom we are familiar. A particularly warlike group of these vrykul known as the Winterskorn would fall under the sway of Ignis and Volkhan, two of Loken's most powerful creations. They would wage a war against the earthen, who, in seeking the aid of Keeper Tyr, also secured the assistance of his dragon allies. Working together as they had to defeat Galakrond, the Aspects succeeded in containing the vrykul forces and sending them into a dreamless slumber that lasted for nearly a thousand years.</p>
                    <p class="righttext">After the Winterskorn War and the death of Keeper Tyr, the enduring bond of the dragonflights he had helped forge what was shattered due to Neltharion's deceit at the Well of Eternity. While this led many dragons, the black and blue in particular, to immediately withdraw into seclusion, Nozdormu was present alongside Ysera and Alexstrazsa at the blessing of the World Tree Nordrassil. Shortly after bestowing his gift of immortality to the night elves, he withdrew into the timeways.
                        By all accounts, the bronze Aspect was not seen again until after the Second War, when the
                        Dragon Queen Alexstrasza was taken prisoner by the Dragonmaw clan. Answering the call of the red consort, Korialstrasz, Nozdormu joined in the Battle of Grim Batol that led to the red Aspect's rescue and the destruction of the Dragon Soul. With his powers renewed, Nozdormu turned to his charge with a renewed vigor. During his explorations, he found a series of temporal anomalies and began to investigate them. Nozdormu ultimately discovered a group of bronze dragon defectors known as the infinite dragonflight.</p>
                        <p class="righttext">
                            He soon discovered that the leader of this group was none other than a future version of himself. Seeking to understand how this could have come to pass, Nozdormu dove deeper into the timeways and soon found himself lost and trapped in all moments in time (a state, I am told, that is quite uncomfortable). After being freed by the orc shaman Thrall, Nozdormu lent his aid to a group of champions sent to confront a series of twisted futures that the bronze Aspect was destined to bring about as the infinite leader Murozond.
                            With the timelines cleansed, the dragonflights turned their attention to retrieving the Dragon Soul from the past so that it could be used as a weapon against Deathwing. After infusing the golden disk with the totality of the Aspects power and Thrall's command of the elements, Nozdormu and his allies ended the threat of both Deathwing and the Hour of Twilight.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/d0sWB6qB/Kairoz-dragon-removebg-preview.png" class="c"></img>
                        <h2 class="lefttext">SORIDORMI</h2>
                        <h4 class="lefttext">Prime Consort of Nozdormu the Timeless One - Leader of the Scale of the Sands</h4>
                        <p class="lefttext">As prime consort of the bronze Aspect, Soridormi serves as the bronze dragonflight's second-in- command and ensures that the directives of her mate are carried out by the rest of the flight. Believed to be nearly as perceptive to the flow of time as Nozdormu, Soridormi was reportedly first to recognize the minute ripples of corruption occurring within the pathways from the infinite dragonflight's interference.
                            Frequent references within the annals of mortal history depict Soridormi as a high elf seeking the help of champions to maintain the proper chronology of events. These concurrent existences most often confuse scholars, especially
                            during the War of the Ancients and the Battle of Mount Hyjal; I've discovered, however, that one can tease out the true timeline by seeking out her dragon form, such as when she helped to empower the Dragon Soul for use against the Legion.
                            Though unconfirmed, it is believed that Soridormi is the guardian of the last two Vials of Eternity, which contain samples drawn from the Well of Eternity before its destruction. Prior to the bronze's acquisition, the vials were known to be in the possession of Illidan Stormrage's fallen lieutenants: the naga, Lady Vashj, and the blood elven prince of Quel'Thalas, Kael'thas Sunstrider.</p>

                    <h2 class="righttext">
                        CHRONORMU</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">Chromie - Ambassador of the Bronze Dragonflight - Time Keeper of the Timewalkers</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">Arguably the most charismatic of all dragons, Chronormu is more commonly known among the mortal races by her visage name, Chromie. In eschewing the typical appearances of either human or elf, Chromie stands out as one of the few dragons to enjoy a gnomish form. As an essential member of the Timewalkers and ambassador of the bronze, Chronormu seems to truly relish her interactions with the mortal races and has taken great efforts to ensure our continued survival.
                        While the bronze's exploits span much of known history, she is most recognized for her extraordinary efforts to repair the timeline corruption caused by the infinite dragonflight. In this role, much of her efforts focused on maintaining the sanctity of the timeline surrounding the Third War, such as the fall of the human capital of Lordaeron and Prince Arthas's infamous culling of Stratholme.</p>
                    <p class="righttext">As Time Keeper of the Timewalkers, Chromie aided Tyrande Whisperwind in presenting 
                        the case against the former Horde warchief Garrosh Hellscream during his trial. Her counterpart, Kairozdormu, offered to deliver the accused's defense but instead assisted in Hellscream's escape to an alternate timeline. In their pursuit, Chromie and her allies discovered the unexpected involvement of the infinite dragonflight along with Kairozdormu's true goal: With the infinite power to change history, he could find a way to defeat the Legion upon their inevitable return to Azeroth.
                        Though Kairozdormu was ultimately betrayed by Garrosh and his plans were subverted, Chromie continued to fight against the infinite
                        dragonflight, which has since come to see her as
                        a direct threat to its unknown motives. With the help of mortal champions, Chromie managed to repair several tampered timelines intended to lead to her "incorrect" death; the identity of those plotting against her remains a mystery at the time of this telling.
                        Despite the ongoing threat to her life, Chronormu's dedication to the bronze dragonflight and Azeroth remains steadfast, as was most recently demonstrated when she provided her essence to empower the artifact known as the Heart of Azeroth, used to defeat the Old God N'Zoth.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/n83YGbkS/Anachronos1-removebg-preview.png" class="e"></img>
                    <h2 class="lefttext">ANACHRONOS THE ANCIENT</h2>
                    <h4 class="lefttext">Heir to the Bronze Dragonflight</h4>
                    <p class="lefttext">Due to the extraordinary lifespan of dragons, I am told that it is unusual for the dragonflights to declare an heir in advance of an Aspect's demise. The exception, of course, are the bronze, who know the exact moment of their own deaths, a fact that leads many scholars to speculate on Nozdormu's future. Whether the Timeless One is destined to be lost in battle or to corruption by
                        the Old Gods, it is the Aspect's son, Anachronos, who will one day take up leadership of the bronze dragonflight. Until that fated moment, the bronze heir acts in much the same capacity as his mother, the prime consort Soridormi, in performing the most vital missions of their flight.
                        Anachronos's greatest feat lies in his heroic efforts to rally the dragonflights against the Old God C'Thun during the War of the Shifting Sands. </p>
                    <p class="lefttext">Though initially successful in holding back the mighty waves of aqir that surged forth from the temple of Ahn'Qiraj, the night elf forces commanded by Fandral Staghelm and Shiromar began to falter after the death of the archdruid's son, Valstann. The loss shattered Fandral's will to fight, leaving the defensive line broken by the murderous aqir, who then set their sights upon the Caverns of Time. With the bronze drawn into the battle, Anachronos called upon the unity of the dragonflights to help push the
                        remnants of the Black Empire back into the temple and seal them away.
                        After the sacrifice of Arygos, Merithra, and Caelestrasz secured the aqir within the walls of Ahn'Qiraj, Anachronos joined his power with that of the druids to erect an impenetrable magical barrier around the accursed city. Named the Scarab Wall, it held for nearly a thousand years until the further weakening of the Old God's prison necessitated its removal to allow heroic champions to battle C'Thun.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/hJ9XNcD0/Grakkarond-removebg-preview.png" class="f"></img>
                    <h2 class="righttext">GRAKKAROND</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">Commander of the Bronze Dragonflight</h4>
                    <p class="righttext">Remembered as a massive bronze capable of rending devastating damage against the enemies of his dragonflight, Grakkarond heeded Anachronos's call to fight the remnants of the Black Empire within the city of Ahn'Qiraj. It is said that the mighty behemoth was felled only due to a cunning ambush by the anubisath Ossirian, a titan-forged guardian corrupted by the Old God C'Thun. Though wounded by the giant's sword, Grakkarond managed to maul Ossirian to near death before hordes
                        of qiraji swarmed over the noble bronze and ended his life.
                        Laying for a thousand years beneath the grueling Silithus sun, the monstrous bones of Grakkarond went on to serve a sacred role to the anubisaths until its recent destruction by the sword of Sargeras. To them, the skeletal remains commemorated the defeat of their most powerful enemy and stood as a testament to their strength. For the Farraki trolls of southern Kalimdor, the half-buried bones form a fertile source of legend.</p>

                    <h2 class="lefttext">ZEPHYR & ZIDORMI</h2>
                    <h4 class="lefttext">Representatives of the Keepers of Time Watchers of the Timewalkers</h4>
                    <p class="lefttext">Most often encountered in their visage forms as a high elf and a human, respectively, Zephyr and Zidormi were said to be claw-picked by Nozdormu himself to serve in the Keepers of Time. As caretakers of the timeways, they are responsible for the more ordinary yet frequent disturbances found throughout the history of Azeroth. Following the loss of the Aspects' powers after the defeat of Deathwing, it was decided that the Keepers of Time would reform into the Timewalkers, who would seek to recruit mortals willing to help protect the pathways of time.
                        Many experienced travelers report their first encounter with a dragon to be within the city of Shattrath, located on the shattered remains of Draenor. Despite the relative security of Outland after the defeat of the Betrayer, Illidan Stormrage,
                        Zephyr is most often found in the World's End Tavern when not otherwise engaged in her crucial work of maintaining the pathway events leading to the Second War.
                        While it has been my experience that most bronze dragons tend to stay aloof, Zidormi seems to relish her work as the keepers' liaison charged with granting mortals essential glimpses of the past. In this capacity, she offers thoughtful insight into events such as the tragic destruction of Theramore by the former Horde warchief Garrosh Hellscream, the Legion's invasion of the Blasted Lands via the Dark Portal, the Horde's burning of the elven capital of Teldrassil, and its reprisal, and the Alliance siege of the Forsaken capital within the ruins of Lordaeron.</p>

                    <h2 class="righttext">EROZION</h2>
                    <h4 class="righttext">Representative of the Keepers of Time
                    </h4>
                    <p class="righttext">Though I'm told the bronze dragonflight had grown increasingly aware of anomalies affecting the sanctity of the pathways, direct contact with the infinite dragonflight occurred only after Erozion sent a group of adventurers back in time to protect the essential history of warchief Thrall's escape from Durnholde Keep.</p>
                    <p class="righttext">Seeing Thrall as a key factor in the Legion's failed invasion of Mount Hyjal, the infinite dragonflight attempted to end the shaman's existence before he established the Horde.To achieve this goal, they sent an assassin known as Epoch Hunter to end the orc's life precisely when his legacy first began to present a threat. Yet by guiding a group of champions through the events of Thrall's liberation, Erozion managed to protect the history of one of Azeroth's most crucial heroes.
                        Though this was not the only attempt by the infinite dragonflight to alter the past and enact its maddened future,the threat to Thrall's fate was successfully averted.</p>
